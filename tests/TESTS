Testing UBA
===========

This file explains some concepts about testing:

Naming Conventions
------------------

Files within the tests folder should fall into onw of these categories:

e-test-session.c (e-*.c)
	These files indicate examples. They usually have two special purposes.
	The first is to be some bright examples for people starting to look at
	the code (»this code works like that«).
	The second purpose is documentation: By having all the code snippets
	from the documentation in this directory, we can savely check whether
	the snippets compile (and thus are recent).

m-uba.c (m-*.c)
	These files contain module tests.

s-mock-session.c (s-*.h)
	These files contain test suites.

t-*.h
	These files contain the test cases.

mock-*.c
	These files contain mock objects and other code that's used by the test
	cases to be able to execute the tests.
